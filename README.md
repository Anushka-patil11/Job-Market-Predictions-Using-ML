#Job Market Predictions: Leveraging Machine Learning to Forecast Employment Trends

#Overview

This repository contains the research and implementation of machine learning models to predict employment trends. The study compares traditional forecasting methods such as ARIMA and Linear Regression with advanced machine learning models like Random Forests and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The goal is to enhance labor market forecasting by leveraging data-driven insights and predictive analytics.

#Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and encoding employment data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in the labor market.

#Machine Learning Models:

Traditional Models: ARIMA, Linear Regression

Advanced ML Models: Random Forest, LSTM

Evaluation Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Comparison of Model Performance: Demonstrating the superiority of machine learning techniques over conventional methods.

#Dataset

The dataset used for this study includes employment statistics from publicly available sources such as:

Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

Kaggle Datasets

Industry-specific employment reports

#Results

LSTM models outperform traditional econometric models by capturing long-term employment trends and nonlinear market fluctuations.

Random Forest models efficiently identify employment patterns based on economic indicators.

Traditional models (ARIMA, Linear Regression) struggle with highly dynamic labor markets, while ML models offer superior accuracy.
